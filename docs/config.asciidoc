= Configuration Options



== Default

By default, the config.yml file in the git repository itself is used.


== Over-ride - YAML file (OpenShift)

In OpenShift, it's relatively easy to create a Config Map, into which a
new config file can be presented.  This config map needs to be mounted 
as /data/config.yml

In the Web Console:

Applications -> Deployments -> (your app) -> Configuration

Under "Volumes" -> "Add Config Files"

Source -> Create Config Map

Name: config.yml (this is the reference for the object)
Key: config.yml  (this is the filename that it's mounted as)
Value: (cut and paste the contents of the yml)


Add the file:

Source: config.yml

Mount Path:  /data



Testing the file is present:

Go to your pod, Terminal, "cat /data/config.yml"


Editing the file:

Resources -> Config Maps -> select config.yml -> Actions -> Edit

You (probably) need to redeploy the app for the edit in the config map
to take effect?


As a comment, OpenShift is also able to handle similar data in secrets
but as this data is not expected to be particularly sensitive the extra
overhead of manipulating base64 data (see below) is less worthwhile.


== Over-ride - base64 env (Heroku harder)

Heroku doesn't have the same concept of config maps.  It does have environment
variables (with a 32k limit) which are easier to set.

To drop a full config.yml into place, base64 encode the file and set it as an
environment variable.

When the application starts, if this environment is found it will be decoded
and overwrite the built in config.yml for use.

$ heroku config:set CONFIG=$( base64 --wrap=0 my.config.yml )



== Over-ride - single URL (Heroku easier)

The base64 method is slightly verbose.  As an alternative, a single URL can be
set in the same environment variable, either the /edit or /export URL (we'll
automatically convert the first format to the second), and when the application
starts a single user named "user" will be configured with this one data source.
