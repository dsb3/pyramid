2018-03-08,10d,TR,H1,Yellow,TRC MV,Horseshoe Left,Bungled sequence at upper roof - also in demo shoes
2018-03-08,10d,TR,RE,Yellow,TRC MV,Horseshoe Left,Went back to get it clean - also in my own shoes

2018-03-11,7,DC,OS,Green,TRC MV,Horseshoe Left,Maybe I upclimbed this before - not sure
2018-03-13,9-,TR,RP,Blue,TRC NR,Back right,Warm-up
2018-03-13,9-,DC,F,Blue,TRC NR,Back right,New rule - first downclimb that wasn't upclimbed will be claimed as flash; downclimb WITHOUT upclimbing the route is OS.
2018-03-13,9,TR,H1,Green,TRC NR,Back left,Funky move with lead climber nearby
2018-03-13,10-,TR,X,Orange,TRC NR,Lead wall,"Shane led, I seconded - got rope caught in clip and fell; couldn't get back on route."

2018-03-18,10c,TR,"A, H2",Red,TRC MV,HS,Aided to the same point and climbed up - fell twice.  Climbs like an 11.
2018-03-18,11a,TR,X,Black,TRC MV,HS R,Fell at the crux move again.  Still no explosive energy for the move.
2018-03-18,11a,TR,X,Green,TRC MV,Desk Area,Lower section felt hard.  I'm just not strong enough to make the crux move yet.
2018-03-18,11d,TR,"H, X",Purple,TRC MV,Right of lead,Easier than I expected - made it half way and called it a day.  Crimpy!

2018-03-22,10c,TR,X,Black,TRC NR,Right Front,Stuck at the same crux move
2018-03-22,10c,TR,X,Yellow,TRC NR,Right Overhang,Too scrunched to stick a hard move; swung out into space
2018-03-22,11a,TR,H1,Yellow,TRC NR,Left Rear,Forgot foot sequence and pumped out
