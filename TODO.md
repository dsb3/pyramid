# TODO

## environment

Make sure pipenv runs properly, with correct libraries

Make notes on sequence to update, if needed.

Make notes on start to finish sequence to install in heroku

Future: notes on how to deploy on openshift, too.


## flask vs django

We need an admin page to edit/update scrape sources to
avoid hard coding the google doc sources.  Maybe django
is a better framework for more complex operations?



## gid=

Support gid for downloading different sheets in one doc


## html

- home page

- links to other pages, scraper etc



## svg

- headers for each vertical column (don't repeat inside each block)

- implement "don't start until" and "stop plotting when" to only show pertinent graphs for each rope

- shrink image to fit 3x wide more easily

- slider for RP / F / OS

- fader for old dates

- show the colours of the routes that were climbed; hover/mouseover to show detail

- show/hide legend based on what's being graphed
