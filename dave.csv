2018-07-26,10d,TR,OS,Grey,TRC MV,Horseshoe Left,"The ""easy"" one, so I did have knowledge that it wasn't consistent 10+ moves"
2018-07-26,10c,TR,"H3, X",Pink,TRC MV,Front Desk,"Hard crux moves.  Fingery.  Tiny crimps.  Fell, and then gave up!"
2018-07-26,9+,TR,H3,Green,TRC MV,Horseshoe Right,So pumpy.  Needed encouragement from Bob to finish the route.
